This week, we're going to take our object and connect it to the Web. If you've
never done Web development before, then I think that you're in for some fun.

The basic idea is this: We're going to create a simple Web application, using
Flask, that will allow us to request the current status of files in a directory.
One URL ('/scan') will create an instance of our object for that directory, scan
the files in it, and store that information (pickled) on disk.
A second URL ('/rescan') will load the pickled version of our object, and will
report what has changed since the last time.  Moreover, it'll give us this
result in JSON.

Now, this is a big task for people who have never done Web development before,
so I'm going to break this stuff into several parts.  If you have done Web
development before, and especially if you've used Flask before, then you might
find this week's exercise to be rather simple.

This week, I want you to write a Web application using the Flask framework that
accepts the "/scan" URL, plus a parameter, a directory name.  It should return a
list of the files in that directory or (if the directory doesn't exist) an error
message.

(And if you're wondering where our objects from last week have gone, the answer
is... we'll connect them to this system next week.)

In order to do this exercise, you'll need to:

Download and install Flask
Create a new Flask application
Write a function that looks for the directory that was requested
Connect that function to the URL /scan
Have the function return a list of files or an indication that the directory
doesn't exist.
