This week, we're going to spend a bit of time exploring a useful module in
Python's standard library: argparse. This module allows you to create command-line
programs that take arguments from the user.  You can, of course, do that with
sys.argv, but then you need to parse the arguments yourself. argparse does a
lot of that work for you.

For this week's exercise, I want you to implement a single program that combines
two classic Unix command-line programs, "head" and "tail".  The "head" command
shows you the first few lines of a file, and the "tail" command shows you the
final two lines of a file. Our "headtail" program will show you the first few
*and* the last few lines of a file. If the user doesn't specify the number of
lines he or she wants to see from the start and end, then the default number
will be 3.

For the purposes of this exercise, we'll assume that the file can fit into memory.

The program will take one positional argument, a filename.

It'll also take two keyword arguments:
-s or --start, indicating how many lines to show from the start (default = 3)
-e or --end, indicating how many lines to show from the end (default = 3)
