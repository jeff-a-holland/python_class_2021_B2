This exercise will extend over several weeks. This week, we'll start the process
by writing a program that collects information about files, and creates a data
structure from that information.

In other words: You should write a function, get_file_info, that takes a single
argument, "pathname," the name of a directory. The program will then go through
each of the files in that directory, as well as in any subdirectories, and will
calculate the SHA-1 of that file.

The program should then produce (and print) a data structure -- a list of
dictionaries -- in which each dictionary will contain the following information:

full path and filename
file timestamp
SHA-1 of the file's contents

This exercise combines a number of different things:
The use of os.walk to go through an entire directory/tree structure
The use of os.stat to retrieve information about files
The calculation of a hash function (SHA-1, in this case) on a file's contents
